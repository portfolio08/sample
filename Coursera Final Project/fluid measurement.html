        <p class="one"> Hey everybody, welcome back. Let's go look at some code together.

What we're looking at here is an example from when we first learned about fluid measurements. We went in and we switched our absolute measurements of pixels and started using percents. And it works out really well,</p>
        <div class="column">
            <h2> Column 1</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing that we need to look at is what these columns are. And what we have is we have dibs each of type class equals column. The nice thing about dibs is that by default, they're block. If we don't do anything at all they're going to be stacked just the way we want them to be. So let's find our code.Play video starting at 1 minute 26 seconds and follow transcript1:26
                Right here. You can see that I went in and I said I only want them to be 30% and in line block. I floated them and all that great stuff there. The truth is, when we think mobile first, weshouldn't be changing anything at all in the column. So I'm going to take this code and I'm going to delete it.Play video starting at 1 minute 47 seconds and follow transcript1:47All right, I've done it, their block, and on the large screen, it looks really silly. But on the smaller screen we have success I was looking for, we have our mobile first view. Now the question is, how do we go from a single column to three columns as we get bigger? And the answer is to use media queries. So I'm going to scroll down to the bottom of my CSS. And I need to add some code.
